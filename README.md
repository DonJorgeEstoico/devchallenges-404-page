## Overview

![screenshot](assets/images/demo-website.png)

- Where can I see your demo? Here <a href="https://devchallenges-404-page-a5kpftgvg-donjorgeestoicos-projects.vercel.app">Demo</a>
- What was your experience? I spent at least 12 hours programming with only pure HTML and CSS languages for this challenge, it was gratifying completing it in less time that I personally thought, some people might done it differently, with more frameworks probably. But in my case I preferally I want it make it with the raw languages for something basic.
- What have you learned/improved? I reviewed the most basic and interesting ways for creating a simple website again, refreshing and practice is the most important thing about programming.
- Your wisdom? Never feel useless or less just because you don't know something easy, medium or hard concepts, or algorithms, you need to practice by learning and mistaking, over and over.
